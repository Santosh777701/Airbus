The `Invistico_Airline.csv` dataset contains information about airline customers and their satisfaction levels with various aspects of their flight experience. Key columns include `satisfaction` (whether a customer is satisfied or not), `Customer Type` (loyal or new customers), `Type of Travel` (business or personal), `Class` (economy, business, etc.), and `Inflight entertainment`, among others. The dataset also contains various features related to the customer experience, such as seat comfort, on-time arrival, food and drink quality, and service ratings. This dataset is used for classification tasks, such as predicting customer satisfaction based on these features.
